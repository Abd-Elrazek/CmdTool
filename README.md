# CmdTool
Command line tool intended to execute console commands easily. 

It is a tiny, pure object-oriented and immutable wrapper for [zt-exec](https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-exec) with additional features while executing external processes from Java. All features of [zt-exec](https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-exec) still available.

Java 8+ required.
